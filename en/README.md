We are pleased being part of the program of the Makerfair-Ruhr in Dortmund!

* from **28.3 to 29.3 2020** in DASA in Dortmund
* see [makerfaire-ruhr.com/maker2020](https://www.makerfaire-ruhr.com/maker2020)

During the whole fair we screw and solder on the models. You may join us and look over our shoulder or get your hands on yourself. What we produce together will be raffled off during the fair.

Whether Space-Invader or Hello World – working models of the „VZ200 Color Computer“ are ready to try. 

At these times, we dig deeper into individual topics:
